# GoldRaccoon

## General Notes

This project started on 29/06/2013 for the Objective-C Hackathon (http://objectivechackathon.appspot.com/).

GoldRaccoon aims to be an evolution of BlackRaccoon, maybe the best third-party component out there for handling FTP operations on iOS.

Recently I forked the public repo of the BlackRaccoon (which is an evolution of WhiteRaccoon) and added some improvements that have been merge into master to BlackRaccoon. Even though BlackRaccoon does what it says, I prefer to clean it a little and use a different and more extensible code structure.

Most of the code is therefore written by Valentin Radu and Lloyd Sargent.

Here is my effort. Let's start.
